# myAdvo

## Description

Marginalized communities — including queer individuals and people of color — often face discrimination, financial constraints, and transportation issues that hinder in person access to vital services.

Stigma & discrimination, financial issues, or legal issues can all stand between people and the resources they need. When barriers prevent access to services, people can put themselves in harm’s way trying to find the help they need.

myAdvo is a resource and referral tool in development that will allow users to have access to high quality, safe, and vetted community resources. We vet each resource we add to our resource library using a stringent list of vetting criteria.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/advocacy-resources/advo.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-directory-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
